We observe that the testsample directory does not contain the classes.dex and resources.arsc files previously present in the ZIP file. We observe that there is a apktool.yml file created in the directory. We also observe that there is another AndroidManifest.xml in a new directory called original. We also observe that there is a new directory called smali which was decompiled from the classes.dex file present in the original APK ZIP archive.

We can save the decompiled JAVA source code as a Gradle project.
